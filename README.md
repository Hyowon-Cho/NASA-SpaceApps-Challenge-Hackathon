# NASA SpaceApps Challenge Hackathon

## Objectives
Detecting seismic activity on Mars and the Moon is essential for understanding planetary geology and enhancing space exploration. Our goal is to develop a model to identify seismic anomalies in planetary data to identify earthquakes. We also want to determine the patterns of seismicity on the Moon and Mars that we hypothesize can be divided into foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks similar to Earth.
